   <h2>I came across the Finnish phrase “olla ei mistään kotoisin” when discussing with researcher/artist Dr. Lena Seraphin. Literally meaning “from nowhere,” it can imply low quality or no worth. What does it mean to come from nowhere? Who decides whose lives and histories are worth archiving?

My project titled Olla ei mistään kotoisin (Of No Origin) seeks to explore how fragmented memory, inherited grief, and cultural displacement shape the perception and construction of the body. To access memories that cannot be fully told, I turn to ruptures, uncontained forms, and broken syntax. 

The body is a central anchor in my artistic research, as both a personal and cultural site of memory—especially the feminine body, the queer body, the “incomplete” or illegible body across borders.

The body also extends into proxy materialities: fragments, extension parts, or replicas of the body. Through field studies, I documented repeating visual patterns across the globe: 
In the yard of a factory exporting worldwide in my hometown’s Buddha Making Village, Chongshan Village, Suzhou, China, I observed piles of deserted Buddha statues and molds; and on the central streets of Accra, Ghana, I witness mounting sacks of discarded mannequin torsos, during the Praxica postcolonial research residency in Villa Karo, West Africa.</h2>
