      <h2>Bio</h2>
      <p>My work lives in the space between memory and myth, where fragments of memory collide with established 
      archives. To access what has been lost, I turn to the body and its afterimages – tracing how bodies unfold in 
      fragmented visual landscapes: in flesh, in clay, in plastic, and in broken syntax. My work interrogates how 
      bodies – gendered, sacred, or discarded – are replaced across cultural, social, and political systems.</p>

      <p>I work across mediums, including glass, ceramics, textiles, moving images, found objects, poems, ritual 
      gestures and interactive installations. My practice embraces materials rich with contraction and hybridity: 
      glass and ceramics that fracture yet endure, textiles that whisper both domestic and transcultural narrations,
      words that knots past to present. Specifically, glass recurs in my practice - its reflective and refractive 
      qualities mirror how memories both distort and illuminate. Resisting the single-story logic of archives, my 
      work makes room for reflection, for intimacy, for what’s lost or barely imagined, and for transformation yet 
      to take shape.</p>
